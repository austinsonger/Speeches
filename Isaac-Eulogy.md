# ISAAC SONGER - EULOGY

> In Loving Memory of Isaac Songer

### September 19, 1984 - June 22nd, 2016


## [INTRODUCTION - SECTION]


Thank you everyone for being here to help us celebrate the life of my brother Isaac. This week is a tough week for my family. But, in spite of the sadness, it's a privilege to say a few words about my brother.

There's an ancient proverb\* that says

> **"It's better to go to a house of mourning than a house of feasting, for death is the end of all men, and the living will lay it to his heart."**

Today is a day where all of us can reflect on the most important things about life and the example that Isaac set for all of us.

My brother was energetic, fairly stubborn, and sometimes a wee-bit on the loud side. But Before I continue...

Please Close your eyes for just a minute, and think about Isaac.Imagine him in front of you, either in a photograph or in a video. What is he doing? What expression do you see on his face?

#### \[PAUSE\]

Okay, open your eyes.

I can tell by the looks on your faces that you saw the samething I saw — that huge, upbeat, grin Isaac always wore. It was there when he watched basketball or football, when he talked about politics, and especially when he went fishing. Did you *ever* see him NOT smiling when he was holding a salmon? (Jared knows what I'm talking about)

Isaac’s smile said everything about him


## [REFLECTION STORY\] - Life is an Echo

A son and his father were walking in the mountains. Suddenly, his son falls, hurts himself and screams: 

> "AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!!!" 

To his surprise, he hears the voice repeating, somewhere in the mountain: 

> "AAAhhhhhhhhhhh!!!"

Curious, he yells: 

> "Who are you?"

He receives the answer: 

> "Who are you?" 

Angered at the response, he screams: 

> "Coward!" 

He receives the answer: 

> "Coward!"

He looks to his father and asks: 

> "What's going on?" 

The father smiles and says: 

> "My son, pay attention." 

And then he screams to the mountain: 

> "I admire you!" 

The voice answers: 

> "I admire you!"

Again the man screams: 

> "You are a champion!" 

The voice answers: 

> "You are a champion!"

The boy is surprised, but does not understand.

Then the father explains: 

>"People call this ECHO, but really this is LIFE. It gives you back everything you say or do. Our life is simply a reflection of our actions. If you want more love in the world, create more love in your heart. If you want more competence in your team, improve your competence. This relationship applies to everything, in all aspects of life; Life will give you back everything you have given to it."

> YOUR LIFE IS NOT A COINCIDENCE. IT'S A REFLECTION OF YOU!

### \[STORY END\]

\[Life Section\]
----------------

He loved basketball, football, fishing, and politics. He loved life and believed in making the most of it. Spending time with my brother was rarely boring. His energy and his smile were contagious and he was the type of person you enjoyed hanging with.

Isaac looked up to President Obama and one of the President's quotes which I think is appropriate for today is 

> "If you’re walking down the right path and you’re willing to keep walking, eventually you’ll make progress." 

Isaac made progress in his life by making sure he stayed on the right path. For Isaac, it was a path of tolerance, enthusiasm\*\*, and energy.


#### \[PAUSE\]

## [TOLERANT TOWARDS OTHERS - SECTION\]

Isaac’s biggest fault was also his greatest asset. He was **tolerant**. He never judged people. Instead, he accepted them for who they are. Some people may be tempted to criticize others for their failures, You see, Isaac knew that everyone was on the verge of his or her personal success.


#### \[PAUSE\]

## [ENTHUSIASM - SECTION\]

Isaac didn't believe in sitting on the sidelines and watching life. As his hero Michael Jordan has said: 

> "Some people want it to happen, some wish it would happen, and others make it happen." 

Isaac was the kind of guy that no matter what issues he faced, he tried to continue and make things happen for himself

He was passionate in his beliefs and always tried to remain positive about life no matter the road blocks that came his way.

#### And if he suffered a setback, he didn't let that stop him. His idol Michael Jordan has a quote 

> "The key to success is failure." 

If you don't succeed at first, learn the lessons from it, and press on. Don't give up. Don't quit.


#### \[PAUSE\]

## [ENERGY - SECTION\]

Those of us who knew my brother will never forget his smile. He smiled almost all the time! He was positive (the majority of the time \[Smirk\]) and upbeat in life.

Life can sometimes be hard, but never become cynical.

Bad things can and will happen, but stay positive. Be the candle in the dark. Be the inspiration to others around you, as my brother was to so many of us.


#### [PAUSE\]

## [LESSONS FOR US ALL - SECTION\]

My brother Isaac was an extraordinary man. His life has left each of us with some great examples -- particularly when it comes to being tolerant, being happy with life, and continuing to fight.

You may be discouraged right now and feeling that circumstances and challenges are getting the best of you. From the basket player Michael Jordan. 

> "You must expect great things of yourself before you can do them."

Expect great things from yourself. Expect great things from life. Expect great things from other people.

These are great lessons - lessons I hope all of us will remember and take to heart.

#### \[PAUSE\]

And finally.

We all suffer some unavoidable losses. People we love die, close friends move away, and, despite our best efforts, some of the ventures we undertake don’t work out. What’s a person to do when he or she suffers a bad break? We can complain, but fussing doesn’t change anything. If we accept our losses, we grieve by crying about them. Crying doesn’t help either. That’s why we cry – because nothing helps. But grieving does allow us to bury our dead and to get beyond our disappointments. 

This leaves room in our hearts that we may be able to fill with love for someone else or hope for some new undertaking, but we cannot hurry our pain to rush our willingness to begin anew. We need to move on in our lives in search of whatever is available that makes us happy, but a major loss leaves a hole in our hearts – a hole that can never be completely refilled.


#### \[PAUSE\]

## [IN CLOSING\]

Please leave today celebrating the life that Issac was able to live.

Please live today with your head up high, because knowing Isaac... 

He would want all of his family friends to continue living in the now, because to often people dwell on the past and worry about the future, so for Isaac please live in the now.

Thank You All For Coming.
